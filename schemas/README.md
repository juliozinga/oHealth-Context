## General use
* Schema 1. PHYSICAL TEST 
* Schema 2. TEST TYPE
* Schema 3. SENSOR TYPE
* Schema 4. SENSOR SPEED
* Schema 5. SENSOR DATA
* Schema 6. TIME INTERVAL 

## Specific purpose (Physical test)
### Test: Timed Up and Go 
Below we present the schemas that correspond to the variables of interest required for each physical test. 
* Schema 7. Step count 
* Schema 8. Walk speed 
* Schema 9. Distance between steps
* Schema 9.1 Distance unit value
* Schema 10. Time between steps

### Test: 30-Second Chair Stand Test
* Schema 11. Number of repetitions
* Schema 12. Time between repetitions

### Test: 4-Stage Balance Test
